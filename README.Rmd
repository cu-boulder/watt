`watt` provides tools to perform tidy power analysis. It is in very early development, and may not even fully exist at all! Mostly it just wraps some fun functions.

## Installation

No CRAN repo exists yet, but you can install from GitHub by using:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('cu-boulder/watt')
```
