`watt` provides tools to perform tidy power analysis. It is in very
early development, and may not even fully exist at all\! Mostly it just
wraps some fun functions.

## Installation

No CRAN repo exists yet, but you can install from GitHub by using:

``` r
devtools::install_github('cu-boulder/watt')
```
